## TeamCode Module

Under the TeamCode Module, all our code is stored (within the legacy folder). Under that, there are 5 packages: 

* a library for base operations: [lib](legacy/lib)
* a folder containing opmodes: [programs](legacy/programs)
* a package with constants and other sources: [src](legacy/src)
* a module for storing the finite state machines: [states](legacy/states)
* a collection of the robot's system-specific code: [subsystems](legacy/subsystems)
